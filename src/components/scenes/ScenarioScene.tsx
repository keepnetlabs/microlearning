  const tactiqRaw = `00:00:01.040 as a devops manager my job is hectic and
00:00:04.400 security is always a top priority but an
00:00:07.919 experience I had last month made me
00:00:10.400 change my behavior one day during my
00:00:13.120 lunch break I received an email that
00:00:15.639 looked like it was from the finance
00:00:17.439 department it asked me to approve an
00:00:20.039 invoice something felt off the invoice
00:00:23.320 number was strange and there were a few
00:00:25.519 grammar mistakes thanks to my cyber
00:00:28.279 security training I quickly realized it
00:00:30.679 was a fishing attempt I thought someone
00:00:33.879 might fall for this but instead of
00:00:36.239 reporting it I moved on with my work
00:00:38.760 assuming it will catch it anyway a week
00:00:42.079 later our company announced a fishing
00:00:44.840 attack has led to a data breach exposing
00:00:47.680 customer
00:00:48.800 information the email I had ignored was
00:00:51.559 part of that attack if I had reported it
00:00:54.719 the whole crisis might have been avoided
00:00:57.600 after the breach the company held a
00:00:59.600 meeting
00:01:00.800 the IT team explained how the attack
00:01:03.199 happened and the Damage it caused not
00:01:05.880 just reputational harm but also
00:01:08.320 Financial loss I was shocked and felt
00:01:11.280 guilty a simple secure reporting
00:01:14.119 Behavior could have made all the
00:01:16.439 difference here's what I learned from
00:01:18.439 this experience don't assume someone
00:01:21.320 else will report it just do it if
00:01:24.119 everyone thinks the same way nothing
00:01:26.439 gets done we all share the
00:01:28.560 responsibility know your company's
00:01:30.960 reporting process if you're unsure ask
00:01:34.680 it there are always tools to make
00:01:37.439 reporting easier never underestimate
00:01:40.399 fishing attacks even one fake email can
00:01:43.439 put the entire company at risk after
00:01:46.560 this incident I realized that combating
00:01:49.079 cyber attacks is only possible when
00:01:51.439 everyone practices secure
00:01:53.640 behaviors identifying a fishing email
00:01:56.520 Isn't Enough you have to take action
00:02:00.000 but`;
